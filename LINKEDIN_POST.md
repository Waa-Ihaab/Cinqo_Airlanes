# LinkedIn Post for Cinqo Airlines Flight Management System

## Post Content

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **Cinqo Airlines** - A Hybrid Flight Management System! ✈️

I've developed a comprehensive flight management solution that combines the performance of C with the user-friendliness of Java. Here's what makes it special:

🎯 **Key Features:**
✅ Complete flight listings and search functionality
✅ Direct flight search between cities
✅ Smart correspondence finder (1-stop connections)
✅ Automated ticket generation
✅ Flight booking history tracking
✅ CSV data import/export capabilities

💻 **Technical Stack:**
• Core Engine: C (for performance-critical operations)
• User Interface: Java (interactive menu system)
• Data Storage: CSV/TXT files
• Build Tools: GCC, JDK 8+

🌍 **Coverage:**
The system manages flights across multiple countries including France, Spain, Morocco, and international destinations like Rome, Berlin, New York, and Tokyo!

📊 **Architecture Highlights:**
The project follows a hybrid approach where the Java interface communicates with the C executable for business logic processing - combining the best of both worlds: Java's ease of use and C's raw performance.

## Professional Version for Portfolio

📢 Proud to present: **Cinqo Airlines Flight Management System**

A production-grade, hybrid architecture solution that demonstrates the power of combining low-level and high-level programming paradigms.

**Project Overview:**
This system manages flight operations including booking, search, correspondence finding, and historical data tracking. The architecture leverages C for computational efficiency in the core engine while providing an intuitive Java-based user interface.

**Technical Implementation:**
• Backend: C with optimized data structures and file I/O
• Frontend: Java with service-oriented architecture
• Data Layer: CSV-based persistence with validation
• Pattern: UI Layer → Service Layer → Native Executable

**Business Logic Includes:**
- Real-time flight availability checks
- Multi-hop route calculation
- Automated document generation
- Comprehensive audit trail

**Key Achievements:**
✓ Successfully integrated cross-language communication
✓ Implemented efficient data validation and filtering
✓ Designed modular, maintainable codebase
✓ Created scalable file-based data management

The project is open-source and available on GitHub. I welcome collaboration and feedback from the development community!
